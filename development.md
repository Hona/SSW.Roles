# Development

As a developer, the role you fit into is based on several factors including:
- The characteristics of the role that you meet and are building towards
- The consistency and rate of improvement over time
- Annual Goals
- Contribution to the overall growth of the development team and success of the business
- Relationships with internal stakeholders, team members and clients (pretty much having a good relationship with everyone!)
